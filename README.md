# Malware app classification in Android Ecosystem using Static and Dynamic Analysis
In this project, I have tried to classify malicious and benign android applications through static and dynamic approach.
In static approach, we will first analyze the permissions asked by benign and malicious apps; for example android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE , android.permission READ_PHONE_STATE etc, and will use them as features to build a model to classify benign and malicious applications to raise a threat alert. We will model the static approach with different machine learning technique and will compare the results.In dynamic approach, we will analyze the network traffic data provided in the dataset for benign and malicious android apps.



# DATASET

## Static Data

For static data analysis, data has been taken from Mendeley Data Repository. For benign and malware data, 10,000 applications have been considered for each benign and malware. The data comprises system permissions asked by the benign and malware android applications. The permissions values includes: Network communication: full Internet access (D), Storage: modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents (D) , Phone calls: read phone state and identity (D) etc. 
Total benign android applications considered: 10,000
Total malware android applications considered: 10,000
Total feature in original dataset : 1438

## Dynamic Data 
The dynamic data has been taken from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (Android Malware Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017). It comprises 4 types of malware families and 1 benign family. 
For preparing the dataset, following families have been taken :
1.	Adware
2.	Ransomware
3.	Scareware
4.	SMSmalware
5.	Benign

The features of this dataset includes, flow duration, protocol used, total forward packets, total backward packets, total length of forward packets, flow bytes etc.
Total feature in original dataset: 85
