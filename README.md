# Malware app classification in Android Ecosystem using Static and Dynamic Analysis
In this project, I have tried to classify malicious and benign android applications through static and dynamic approach.
In static approach, we will first analyze the permissions asked by benign and malicious apps; for example android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE , android.permission READ_PHONE_STATE etc, and will use them as features to build a model to classify benign and malicious applications to raise a threat alert. We will model the static approach with different machine learning technique and will compare the results.In dynamic approach, we will analyze the network traffic data provided in the dataset for benign and malicious android apps.


# INTRODUCTION
Android is the most widely used operating system for mobile development and has maximum usage in the mobile operating system. As it has maximum users, the threats involved with malware application also increases. Malware creators try to mimic their application with a benign one and it is essential to dive in-depth into the working and execution of applications. There are different techniques to identify applications as malware, but these techniques are not much effective when used in a stand-alone fashion manner. If these techniques are used combined together to form a hybrid technique, the accuracy of catching a malware application increases. In this report, we have tried two approaches for predicting malware applications. The Android Malware static data is taken from Mendeley Data Repository and the dynamic data is taken from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (Android Malware Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017). First, machine learning classification algorithms are tried on static data which comprises the permissions of the applications. On dynamic data which is the network data, a neural network using Keras is used to predict the same. The accuracy achieved with static data is more than the dynamic data.

# DATASET

## Static Data

For static data analysis, data has been taken from Mendeley Data Repository[5]. For benign and malware data, 10,000 applications have been considered for each benign and malware. The data comprises system permissions asked by the benign and malware android applications. The permissions values includes: Network communication: full Internet access (D), Storage: modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents (D) , Phone calls: read phone state and identity (D) etc. 
Total benign android applications considered: 10,000
Total malware android applications considered: 10,000
Total feature in original dataset : 1438

## Dynamic Data 
The dynamic data has been taken from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (Android Malware Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017). It comprises 4 types of malware families and 1 benign family. 
For preparing the dataset, following families have been taken :
1.	Adware
2.	Ransomware
3.	Scareware
4.	SMSmalware
5.	Benign

The features of this dataset includes, flow duration, protocol used, total forward packets, total backward packets, total length of forward packets, flow bytes etc.
Total feature in original dataset: 85
